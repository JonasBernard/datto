# Workshops Backend

Stateless backend implementation of a tool to assign people into groups (workshops) using Go.

This implementation uses my own go module for the algorithmic part of the problem
which is located at https://github.com/JonasBernard/min-cost-max-flow.

To start, execute
```
go run src/main.go
```
